"""
Welcome to TP 2.

In this module you'll train recurrent neural networks to predict future Paris
temperatures based on the past temperature observations. This is an autoregressive
forecasting model.

Everything is implemented in PyTorch and you will learn how to use some basic PyTorch
functionalities: DataLoader, Dataset, the Adam optimizer, recurrent neural network
modules, etc.

A lot of the work when working on time series data and recurrent models requires some
understanding of sequences, indexes and computational graphs. Don't hesitate to use
pen+papers or whiteboards to fully understand the inputs, outputs and operations within
your models.
